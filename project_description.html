            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Overview</h2> 
            <br>
            <h3>1) Topic</h3>    
                <p>
                   <br>
                   Speaking of my own recommendations, I've made quite a few suggestions for my project this time around. It would be very lengthy to say the whole thing, so I'll focus on the basics that have a relatively large impact on the members and projects. It can be said that the idea of ​​a project related to Health was initiated by me with the input of a few members. After learning about the current situation, I came up with an idea to design an online form of medical examination and treatment. Since then, I have pointed out to everyone, everyone after listening and discussing together, all reached a consensus and started to work on this project. Besides, it's been a long time since I've worked with everyone on the project, I have a fairly clear understanding of the skills, strengths and qualifications of the members. Therefore, as soon as the idea of ​​our Health project was conceived, I gave my opinion and suggested to everyone that we should do it in the form of an application, because I myself and team members all have strengths in developing an application on the mobile platform. Also, since this is also a big project on our hands, in order to make everything go smoothly, I decided to meet with the members to propose creating a timetable with a certain level of detail. This is so everyone can keep up with and track each other's progress, both to help keep no one left behind and to keep our work on time. All members have agreed to do this.
                   <br>
                   Although it has not been long since the start of the project, I still see the positive results that the proposals have brought. Choosing a project as a Health application in the context of today's stressful pandemic will really bring a lot of benefits, we are all very pleased when we have thought of a project that can have a great impact on the health sector today and even in the future. As for choosing the direction of programming a mobile application, because everyone is working in their forte. Besides, having a clear plan after spending a lot of time discussing together, I expect that we will have a very smooth working process without encountering too much difficulty. This also creates an opportunity for us to have the time as well as the space for us to be able to cope in the event of an unexpected incident. Therefore, while these suggestions may seem very simple, I believe they will prove more and more effective.
                   <br>
                </p>  
            <h3>2) Motivation</h3> 
                <p>
                    <br>
                    As everyone knows, the current Covid-19 pandemic situation is extremely stressful around the world and particularly in Vietnam. Although more than 2 years have passed, everything has not shown signs of ending, even the pandemic is likely to continue when recently, the number of infections spiked due to the Omicron mutation. Covid-19 has left extremely serious consequences in all fields, especially the medical field. Hospitals were all overwhelmed during the pandemic, which led to the fact that patients with other diseases also had difficulty in getting medical care for themselves. This leaves a lot of serious consequences, even the worst one, death. According to a statistic at the Ho Chi Minh City Dermatology Hospital, the number of medical examination cases here during the outbreak was only 700 cases/day, while this number on normal days is 2000-2500 cases/day. 
                    <br>
                    After witnessing this heartbreaking situation, my team and I came up with the idea of ​​​​designing a medical application that people can use for online medical examination and treatment. This will be an extremely ambitious project because currently on the Vietnamese market, there is almost no product application similar to ours. And more importantly, if this project is successfully developed, it will be a turning point for today's healthcare industry in Vietnam. For example, in the context of Vietnam, the overload of front-line hospitals will be relatively solved, the crowded scenes will be almost reduced and appear less. Thereby helping to create both convenience for the patient and also help to protect the physical facilities and health of doctors and nurses. Not only that, our application also helps reduce the pressure on doctors by applying AI technology, one of the trends of IT in recent years, to support medical examination and treatment. AI will act as a virtual assistant to support doctors and can also examine patients with simple diseases to create a resting space for doctors.
                    <br>
                </p>    
            <h3>3) Landscape</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    Currently, online medical examination and treatment is also gradually being noticed by people. In the world, a number of health applications as well as online forms of treatment have also been implemented to some extent, for example a few applications such as Doctor on Demand, LiveHealth Online Mobile, etc. These applications have been put into operation and obtained initial positive results. However, most applications with this function are not supported in Vietnam. Current health applications in Vietnam often focus only on storing electronic health records, monitoring daily health such as electronic health book applications, PC-Covid, or Samsung Health, Apple Health. Therefore, it can be said that the application field that we target is a relatively new thing in Vietnam, there will be not many competitors, perhaps just those who are just starting the project like us or some Startup teams. However, our application still has certain differences, this application will not only have medical examination and treatment in the style of regular video calls, but will also incorporate AI. AI will act as a virtual doctor as well as an effective assistant for doctors. We believe that the presence of AI will make a difference and blow a new wind into the field of health applications not only in Vietnam but also internationally.

            <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>1) Aims</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    Our project is to develop a medical app using AI (Artificial Intelligence). Currently, on the market, there have been many types of medical apps appearing for the purpose of declaring vaccination information, treating diseases with doctors in local hospitals, etc. Countless such medical apps were born, and it is also of interest to many people. That is why we decided to make an AI – powered medical app. Our aim in developing such a product was to: 
                    <br>
                    - Access to modern technology: AI is a technology trend that is applied a lot in life and researches a lot for the future. AI was assumed to simulate human reasoning, giving the ability of a computer program to learn and think. Such a man-made anthropomorphic intelligence has been developed as simple rule-based systems, symbolic logical general AI, and sub-symbolic statistical narrow AI. Such an AI is an automation technology that emulates human performance, typically by learning from it, to enhance existing applications and processes. Besides, AI can manage medical records and quickly enter user data. Instead of waiting for an employee to have to look at thousands of numbers and enter each number into each patient’s record, AI can handle this problem quickly and not keep users waiting for long. Currently, there are many applications that use Ai to provide medical advice based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Patients can report their symptoms into the app, which then uses voice recognition to compare with existing disease databases. The app will then provide suggested actions to the user’s medical account history. The AI system was created to help select the right treatment.
                    <br>
                    - Convince for travel: This app is very handy, especially for those who live in the suburbs or in the provinces. When they or a loved one is sick, it takes them a long distance to go to a hospital in the city to see the illness. It is in a sick state but if the disease is not serious but also needs proper treatment, it takes time to go that far. This medical app is a solution to those problems. When users are not seriously ill, they can diagnose the disease through AI on the app to know how they need to be treated. 
                    <br>
                    - Can view the disease 24/24: Unlike the hourly staff, our medical app works 24/24 even on public holidays to be able to consult and treat patients at all times.
                    <br>
                    - User-friendly and gives the best advice: The AI staff of our medical app is very friendly and dedicated to users. Depending on the severity of the disease, the AI staff will advise in detail whether to treat at home or not. When treated at home, the treatment methods that the AI staff recommend are based on medicine and science to help the patient recover the fastest and best. Furthermore, the phone’s webcam is partnered with AI that will automatically confirm when a patient is taking prescription medication and help them manage their condition.
                </p>    
            <h3>2) Plan and Prcesses</h3>
            <br>    
                <p>
                    It can be said that our project this time is a very ambitious project. We understand that the higher the ambition, the higher the difficulty and complexity will be. Therefore, one of the first things we do as soon as we have a complete idea of ​​the project is to create a plan of relatively high detail to be able to start the project fluently. A good project cannot be complete without a good plan. After a very careful meeting and spending time discussing together, we have drafted a relatively complete plan with clearly divided stages.
                    <br>
                    - Phase 1 (takes place over 3 weeks): it is to make specific plans of what needs to be done and gather the necessary data and resources to be able to get started. During this stage, each of us was assigned a specific role. This plan was prepared by us during this very period. During the preparation, we realized our first difficulty, which was the lack of equipment. Initially, we planned to develop this Medical Health Care application on both iOS and Android platforms, but to be able to develop on iOS, we will need at least one Mac to be able to program. Buying a new machine is too expensive, can't be done, we tried to find a solution that is using a virtual machine running MacOS, this seems possible but the efficiency is not as expected, so we I had to decide that I would temporarily put aside the issue of the iOS operating system and focus on developing the Android part. During weeks 2 and 3, we planned to test out a prototype to get a rough look. Although during the implementation process, we encountered many difficulties when we had to deal with some new knowledge and did not have much experience, we still finished on time and produced 2 prototypes for experiment.
                    <br>
                    - Phase 2 (weeks 4 to 6): once the prototypes were in place, we went together in consultation with several experts and other applications we continuously developed and tweaked to deliver a test run. We were on schedule with that plan to conduct a test run. Although the test run has met some requirements, in general, the errors that arise can be said to be a lot and there will still be a lot of tweaking. During this stage, it is also inevitable that difficulties arise, we have encountered many errors and do not know how to handle them, such as query errors but cannot output the desired data. We had to consult a lot on Stackoverflow and some acquaintances to be able to solve it. And this is our current process. For the next week, our plan will be to continue developing UI Design and Database. Fullstack members and AI Developer will work together to start the first steps to create working algorithms for AI. During this time, although we have not experienced it, we can still predict the difficulty we will face, it may be in UI Design. Our team members are not very familiar with using Adobe XD or Sketch, so it may take some time to learn, leading to rescheduled plans.
                    <br>
                    - Phase 3: From here on will only be our plan as our work process has not yet reached this stage. According to our discussed plan, in this phase, algorithm research and AI development will be conducted continuously and will be conducted within 4 weeks (from week 6 to week 10) and AI Training lasts from week 6 until the end of the plan. Researching AI will be really difficult and encounter many obstacles. We have learned that to be able to create an algorithm for AI is extremely complicated and will require a lot of specialized knowledge in the field, both Machine Learning and Data Scientist. We, a team that is still very shallow in knowledge, will find it difficult, if not nearly impossible, to develop a real AI. Therefore, everyone agreed that for the time being we will develop this AI as a virtual assistant for doctors and will also only be able to perform certain simple commands. Besides, this phase is also the phase where we will continue to develop, fix the bugs from the previous test and add some missing features than expected. We will try to complete basic functions such as video calls, medical records, account information, and chat with doctors. If all is completed as planned, we will conduct the second test.
                    <br>
                    - Phase 4: This will be an extremely important phase for our project. Going back to a while ago, in the first weeks, we also had a meeting to discuss a plan that would be what if the workload of this project was too much, we only had 4 people. Is it enough to carry all of them, what if we can't? This is a huge problem, but we have found a solution that is Outsource. When we feel we can't really handle the amount of work, we turn to this solution. Therefore, in the working period from our current progress to this stage, we will base on the situation to make the most specific assessment. Assuming that we have to find an Outsource solution, then the Outsource integration will take place in this phase. In addition to this, we will still try to continue to develop based on the results from testing in phase 3. We predict that if everything goes according to plan and there are no unexpected obstacles, we will be able to complete the application to a relatively high level. And what follows is that we will do the initial rollout, open a public test for both beta testers and some invited general users. After the test period is over, we will give a Survey form to the participants to collect their suggestions and opinions during the experience.
                    <br>
                    - A short break (lasts for a week): We have also been taught that resting after a long period of work is also one of the conditions for effective completion of work. So, after doing the Public test and collecting the opinions of the participants, we decided to give everyone a break for a week so that they can relieve the accumulated stress and fatigue that condensate after a long period of work.
                    <br>
                    - Phase 5 (probably the last stage of the current plan): In this phase, after the Public test takes place, we will collect all the opinions of those who have participated and together Read and study them together. Since we don't have much experience, we think there will be a lot of feedback on the design, tweaking a bit about the user interface as well as the quality of the video calls. We will all take note of it all and conduct a thorough development to be able to bring the product which is the Medical Health Care application in the best possible state. This can take 1 to 2 weeks. And then there was the most important part of the whole project, the joint approval of the medical community and the hospital. It's going to be a very difficult journey as we both have to prove our product reliable and showcase its outstanding features. And after the above works are completed, we will carry out the operation and continue to carry out maintenance and maintenance work to keep the system stable.
                    <br>
                    - Future plans: Although the planned application has been basically completed so far, there are still things that need to be resolved, which is upgrading the AI system and keeping up with the trend. Since we were short on AI knowledge in the beginning, we just made it simple. So, after accumulating more knowledge, we will definitely draw up a specific plan to be able to upgrade the AI system to the level that we set out from the beginning, a doctor virtual. In addition, today's technology trends are constantly changing, so we will also continue to understand trends and draw up more plans to continuously upgrade, to help the application not be outdated before the trend.

            <h3>3) Roles</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    For our team, clearly dividing tasks and roles among team members is one of the extremely important tasks and has been prioritized by us right after brainstorming the concept. project. Partly because we had the opportunity to work together for a while, we were able to assign roles to each member quickly. Our team includes all 4 members, all of whom are divided into very specific jobs:
                    <br>
                    - Vu Hoang Son (Lead Developer and AI Developer): This is the member with the most programming experience in the group, so he is trusted by everyone and assigned to take on this role. He is mainly responsible for setting up algorithms for AI and AI training. Besides, he will also be able to guide, answer questions and can participate in supporting the work of other members when facing obstacles.
                    <br>

                    - Lam Nhi Khang (Documenter and Fullstack Developer): This member is known for his good writing ability and can handle desk jobs well. Therefore, is responsible for the work related to statistics, reports and related paperwork. But his main job is still a fullstack developer. He will have touring missions. When everyone in the team has a hard time or the workload is too much, he will support that person. He mainly supports Vy (UI Design) and Ha (DBM), he can also help with the code for Son (AI Developer) if needed.
                    <br>
                    - Pham Viet Ha (Database Manager): This member used to have experience in database management due to having attended classes and had experience in this field before. He will shoulder the database part for this project. Managing the database will require a lot of experience and knowledge so we found him the best fit for this project. Besides managing the database, he will also provide support for Son AI (Developer) when needed.
                    <br>
                </p>

            <h3>4) Scope and Limits</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Scope</h3>
            <br>    
                <p>
                    - A medical app that helps and keeps track of people’s health in the midst of Covid-19:
                    <br>
                    + A login system: each user will have a separate account,
                    <br>
                    + A main page showing a brief summary of the user’s record,
                    <br>
                    + A user profile: it will have everything from past medical records and all the treatments,
                    <br>
                    + Vaccination information: a page linking with PC-Covid’s data to show the user their vaccination record,
                    <br>
                    + Location saver: a list of locations the user has gone to and scanned using PC-Covid app,
                    <br>
                    + Diseases’ information: every information about known diseases for the user to look up.
                    <br>
                    + An appointment scheduling: a page recording all the appointment schedule and upcoming appointment for the user,
                    <br>
                    + A prescription record: a record for prescriptions that the user can use and go to a local pharmacist or a hospital for the medicines.
                    <br>
                    - A chatbot integrated with AI that will accompany patients and ask about their current health:
                    <br>
                    + 24/7 chatbot: user can talk to a chatbot about their health,
                    <br>
                    + While talking to the bot, it will ask the user questions about their current health. And based on the responses, it will tell the user what the problem is,  what kind of self-treatment is recommended and whether or not a doctor consulting is needed,
                    <br>
                    + When a consultant is needed, an appointment will be made and recorded for ease of use for the user.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    - We will not have a payment system for the prescription and appointment,
                    <br>
                    - This project’s initial launch plan will only be available in Vietnam. We do have plans to launch it globally.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Project deliverables</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    The complete app project will include:
                    <br>
                    + A private individual record for each patient recording their health,
                    <br>
                    + An appointment and prescription record,
                    <br>
                    + A user profile: it will have everything from past medical records and all the treatments,
                    <br>
                    + A chatbot with AI integration asking patients of their health and giving medical recommendation accordingly based of our AI training,
                    <br>
                    + A prescription holder that can be written by the consulting doctor.
                    <br>
                </p>
            <h3>Limits and constraints</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    - Location service: it is required that the user scan the location using PC-Covid app, but if they don’t scan it, then no location will be recorded
                    <br>
                    - Doctor’s monitoring: our project is still limited and needs our team monitoring alongside the doctor’s assessment in order to keep everything correct. We are planning to give it some update so the doctor can do everything with little help from the team.

                    - AI’s efficiency: because the chat bot is using an AI, the early stages of the app will most definitely give some weird responses (but we will make sure to limit this problem). And as time goes on, the AI will get better and give more precise judgements.

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    Programming languages: C#, C++, Java, (HTML, CSS, JS), Python, MySQL, Angular, Core Java, Jersey Rest, EclipseLink.
                    <br>
                    These are the tools we will use to code the app:
                    <br>
                    - Microsoft Visual Studio
                    <br>
                    - Visual Studio Code
                    <br>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    Testing frequency: 2 times for each development phase and each time codes are pushed.
                </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Testing brief</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    For in-development testing: We will have test cases for each functionality of the app (more cases with further development). Once all test cases have passed, the code is good to go.
                    <br>
                    After each development phase: This is when we complete a feature and wanted to test out if it’s working or if it’s clashing with any other features:
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>

            <br>
                <p>
                    Because this app will be used by the public and doctors, this step is the most important to the working of the app.
                    <br>
                    Docter 
                    <br>
                    + Number of doctors: 2,
                    <br>
                    + Number of user: 4,
                    <br>
                    + Description: A set of users will be using the app with the 2 doctors, after which, the doctors will give feedback on the correctness of the app.
                    <br>
                    User

                    <br>
                    + Description: A group of users will test out the app, all of which will be asked to use the app normally and test out a list of functionality provided and write down what they think for each functionality. If the majority comments poorly on the same thing, we will need to fix ASAP, otherwise, we will look into it to see if there’s something wrong.
                    <br>
                    Survey & Feedback (once the app is published)
                    <br>
                    + Number of people: people using the app,
                    <br>
                    + Description: users will be asked to fill out a survey regarding the app about anything they would like to change.

            <h3>Risks</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    Our topic is to create a medical app and there can be difficulties during the implementation of the project. Team members lack experience in creating software, so they cannot create complete or customized software, but can only create basic. 
                    <br>
                    Inaccuracy during examination: there will be incorrect medical examination or wrong medical examination. When medical examination via AI, the user will be diagnosed through the camera on the phone without supporting medical devices, a wrong diagnosis will occur. 
                    <br>
                    Lack of equipment, for example: the group plans to work on both iOS and Android operating systems. However, to make iOS apps, you need a computer with iOS operating system. Lack of devices leads to when users using the iOS operating system want to use the app, they do not have it.
                    <br>
                    Late group meeting: the schedules of different group members make it difficult to plan group meetings. When it is not possible to meet with members to discuss ideas, preparing an idea for a project is difficult because other members will not know what ideas and how to do it.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Group processes and communication</h3>    
            <br>
                <p>
                    From the moment we formed the team and met to discuss previous projects, we both determined and agreed that maintaining communication and connection between members was extremely important. Maintaining contact will contribute a significant part to the success of the project, so after learning that everyone uses Facebook and Messenger mainly, we set up a small chat group on it so we can easily communicate with each other. Not only stopping at chatting, we still plan to have live talks and exchanges with each other. Before that, the members were fully vaccinated and the epidemic showed signs of abating. We planned that we would have a face to face group meeting every week from 1 to 2 times depending on the importance of the content. However, it is a pity that the epidemic has shown signs of stress again, so we were forced to change the meeting format to online. In this case, we use Teams and Google Meets to video call and talk together. 
                    <br>
                    Our communication frequency is quite continuous, chat messages on the Messenger group take place almost daily, we constantly update the situation, notify the progress and urge each other. Meetings through Teams or Meets will often take place on weekends when most members are free, our meetings will last depending on the content we need to discuss, it often lasts for 1 to 2 hours. Recently, when the school campus reopened to students, we had the opportunity to meet in person and we always took advantage of the time after school. The work and content we discussed will all be noted in Google Doc for members to know the progress. 
                    <br>
                    Although meeting quite often, there are still members who are absent from the meetings and have little interaction with the rest of the members. In this case, we will still text you regularly so that you can update the situation. The note of activities that have been, need or will be done for that member will be posted to Doc. Thereby helping us always maintain the efficiency of the project implementation process.
