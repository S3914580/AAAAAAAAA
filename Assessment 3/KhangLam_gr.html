                    During the time Assignment 3 took place, I participated as actively as possible in the assigned tasks (I was assigned to Overview, Plans, and Progress, Roles, Group processes and communications, Skills and Jobs, a bit about Team Profile, Tools). I also participated in reading and giving feedback to other members' work, summarising everyone's reports, uploading and hosting our website. My activity frequency is also quite often shown in pictures 1 and 2. Not only me but the other members also tried their best, this is one of the nicest and brightest. We discussed and came up with unique ideas, everyone was very united and willing to support each other. It is a pity that in the process of working, our group has a rather slow start, plus it is unfortunate that one member is seriously ill, so our articles, especially the Presentation, did not have the best preparation. If we had more time or if we had started earlier, I believe we could have improved and perfected. This is my biggest lesson in this group work. I will try to do everything at a fast pace from the first day. The thing that surprised me the most about this group work was everyone's spirit of not giving up, even though the deadline was very close at that time, the sick member couldn't be active much but everyone still tried their best to achieve success.
