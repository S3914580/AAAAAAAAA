            <h1>Bui Anh Vy</h1>
            <h2>UI/UX Designer</h2> 
                <p>
                    My nationality is Vietnamese and I live in Ho Chi Minh City. This is the second semester of my first year in RMIT.
                    I'm Vietnamese and I was born in Ho Chi Minh City. I've lived in this city for 19 years.
                    I don't travel often but I really love travelling.
                    I want to go places that have delicious foods, beautiful scenery and fresh air.
                    My hobby is watching and reading, but I prefer reading novels. I like outdoor activities such as badminton, swimming, rollerblading.
                    I also like playing piano. My favorite pets are cats especially Munchkins.

            <h1>
                IT interest
            </h1>
            <p>
                I choose IT because I feel it is very interesting with what we do with technology, I am not suitable to communicate with many people and like to calculate. Moreover, the IT industry has great job potential when graduating and has a good income.
                I became interested in computers when I was in 8th grade. At that time, I had to take a job exam to prepare for the exam when I finished grade 9 and computer science was a compulsory subject in my school.
                I studied Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Pascal and how to create a basic website.
                Then I found computer and science very useful and decided to choose IT when I applied for the university entrance exam.
