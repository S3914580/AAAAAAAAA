                    Prior to joining RMIT, I was a student at Prior to joining RMIT, I was a student at  Swinburne in Melbourne, Australia. 
                    I finished the Diploma of Information  Technology and 1.5 year of the Bachelor of  Computer Science. But due to the pandemic  situation, I had to go back to Viet Nam and  postponed my studies in Australia. 
                    After a year of waiting to continue in Australia,  I decided to transfer to RMIT in Vietnam to  continue.

                Despite having completed the Diploma of IT in Swinburne, IT is not my forte and I am not at all  interested in IT. 
                I am more interested in Computer science, which is in the making of games.
                Even without any interest, I am able to understand the importance of IT in Game Development and also what IT skills you can learn from Game Dev like:
                <li>Programming logic from making games, </li>
                <li>Online tools and search engine used to research on the game or the process of making it,</li>
