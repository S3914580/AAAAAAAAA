            <h1>Hoang Son Vu</h1>
            <h2>Group Leader and Web Developer</h2> 
                <p>
                    I am Vietnamese and I was born in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I  completed eleventh grade in a high school in Vietnam and started studying abroad in Australia. I  had almost 2 years studying in Sydney and then came back to Ho Chi Minh city due to COVID 19 outbreak. 
                    I love Maths, Computer and Technology so that I think IT would be a field that is  most appropriate for me. Outside of university, I have a strong passion on playing football and  taking care of my pet. 
                    I have an extremely adorable but slightly naughty female cat. 
                    It is quite  interesting that I like crowded and bustling activities, and because of that, my extrovert personality  is dominant. 
                    I love person-to-person interaction, but perhaps the overwhelming number of people  involved makes me feel uncomfortable.

                IT interest
            </h1>
            <p>
                My path to the IT industry is quite complicated. 
                At the age of 17, I did actually not know what my  passion is, which discipline is appropriate for me and which occupation I should do in the future.
                I did research on the most in demand professions in Vietnam and the world as well as took a deep  dive into every single profession that I thought I might love it.
                Furthermore, IT graduates would likely easy to find a permanent position in a company in the  modern era that technology is the leading field.
                In addition, graduate students who take an entry level position with a start-up or a huge tech business are likely to achieve massive development in  the short term.
                Besides, I am a big fan of Elon Musk whose business deals with technology, smart  cars, application and so on.
                He is extremely successful in the technology field and also famous because of his net worth which is highest in the world.
                Tesla and PayPal are two companies that use IT  applications to bring him huge profits every year.
