                    I think when you look at my name you probably already guessed my nationality, and the answer is yes, I'm Vietnamese. 
                    I was born and raised entirely in Ho Chi Minh City. 
                    In my daily life activities, I will use Vietnamese because it is my mother tongue and everyone speaks Vietnamese. 
                    But besides that, I still regularly use and improve English because it is a necessary language for me to use in my study and working environment. 
                    I am a huge fan of cats. 
                    For me, cats are just like a friend, playing with them in my free time or after stressful working sessions helps me relieve stress very effectively. 
                    In addition, raising them is also very interesting, the feeling of witnessing a cat from childhood to adulthood is great.
                    And now I also have 2 cats for myself, they are British cats and they are really cute.

            <h2>
                IT interest
            </h2>
            <p>
                IT really has a lot of things that make me pay attention and feel interested in them. 
                But one of the things that makes me feel most excited about IT is the unlimited creativity, especially in software programming. 
                I feel that I am free to be creative, create new applications and software without too many constraints. 
                In addition, another thing that makes me pay attention to information technology is that it is always innovating and updating the most advanced technologies continuously. 
                Thereby, I see that IT will always be innovative and never out of date. 
                As I started to grow up, I gradually became interested in electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets and especially how software is created and works inside devices. 
                And it all started when in high school I was taught Pascal and other programming languages. 
                As soon as I learned and tried to program simple lines of code, I felt very excited and happy to program something, even a basic and simple program. 
                From there, I started to spend more time learning about programming and related things. 
                That's when I determined my desired career is IT.
